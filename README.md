# Finance App in React Native with Expo Router 
A sleek, mobile-first Finance App UI built with Expo Router v3 and React Native, featuring a custom bottom tab navigator and interactive pie charts powered by react-native-gifted-charts.
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) to create a Finance App UI in React Native. Along with App UI, here I've implemented custom bottom tabbar navigator with expo router v3 and pie chart with [react native gifted charts](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts) package.
